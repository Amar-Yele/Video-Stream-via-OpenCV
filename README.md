# Video-Stream-via-OpenCV
Real Time Video Stream Using OpenCV with Java

## Title: Real-Time Video Stream Analysis Application

### Description:
This project is a real-time video stream analysis application built using Java, JavaFX, and OpenCV. 
The application processes video streams to detect faces, pedestrians, and moving objects, with capabilities to record the processed video.

### Features:

Face Detection: Uses Haar cascade classifiers to identify faces.

Pedestrian Detection: Detects pedestrians using Haar cascades.

Motion Tracking: Applies background subtraction to track moving objects.

Video Recording: Saves the video with annotations to a specified file.

git clone https://github.com/Amar-Yele/Video-Stream-via-OpenCV.git

Set up dependencies:

Ensure you have Java JDK 21 and JavaFX SDK 21.0.4 installed.
Configure your IDE to include the JavaFX libraries and OpenCV native libraries.

### Usage:

Launch the application and click Start to begin processing the video stream.
Use Stop to end the session and save the recorded video.
